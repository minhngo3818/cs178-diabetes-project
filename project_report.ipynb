    "\n",
    "Different machine learning models and neural networks yield different results with different characteristics. In this project, we use Diabetes from 130 US hospitals within 1999-2008 as the input dataset in order to test out several classification methods of machine learning including k Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Feed-Forward Neural Network (with pytorch). We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of each method and draw conclusions about their strengths and weaknesses. After working on this project, data preprocessing is the most important part to acquire high quality classification models. Among those classification methods, random forest the best method to apply to this dataset."

    "- Data preprocessing is the most crucial part to for training classifiers. Grouping some categorical feauter such as admission_type_id, discharge_disposition_id is difficult to generalize due to some lack of connections. The accuracy from all models are around 60% which is way far from the expection of higher than 80% accuracy. Low quality training dataset and large size are the main reasons. In several attempts to achieve high quality traininh data, one hot encoding was applied. It put categories in separate columns for a categorical feature. Categorical features create too many one hot encoded columns that have high correlation, which is bad for some classifiers. Logistic regression was not converge and other models yield low accuracy. "
