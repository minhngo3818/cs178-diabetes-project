    "Different machine learning models and neural networks yield different results with different characteristics. In this project, we use Diabetes from 130 US hospitals within 1999-2008 as the input dataset in order to test out several classifying methods of machine learning including k Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Feed-Forward Neural Network (with pytorch). We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of each method and draw conclusions about their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
